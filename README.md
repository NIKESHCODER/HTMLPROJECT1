**ðŸ“˜ Backtracking Visual Demo**
This project is a simple HTML and CSS-based visual explanation of the Backtracking Algorithm. It explains how backtracking works through examples, Java-style pseudocode, and a puzzle (Cindyâ€™s Puzzle) using a grid of black and white balls.<br>

**ðŸ§  What is Backtracking?**
Backtracking is a recursive problem-solving technique used to solve constraint satisfaction problems such as puzzles, mazes, and games like Sudoku or N-Queens. It incrementally builds candidates and abandons paths that fail to satisfy the constraints.<br>

**Cindy's Puzzle â€“** an interactive-like representation using ball images****

**ðŸ§© Cindyâ€™s Puzzle**<br>
In this puzzle, you have:<br>

n black marbles on the left<br>

n white marbles on the right<br>

1 empty space in the center<br>

**Goal:** Move marbles so their positions are swapped (black â†” white) using rules:<br>

Black marbles move only right<br>

White marbles move only left<br>

Marbles can move to empty spaces or jump over one marble<br>
